She currently works as a Recruitment Specialist for a home health company located in Ontario Canada. She is also 37 weeks preganant and is due mid December.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in July of this year, all staff were given raises to align with new standards for the entire organization. Due to seniority and differences in wages, not everyone received the same increase. Her salary had increased from $46k/year to $55k/year. She later had a meeting with the Operations Manager (around August 2018) to discuss the increase in her salary (operations met with all employees weeks after increases were given). During this meeting her new salary ($55k/year) was confirmed by the Operations Manager however she did not receive any documentation; the Operations Manager had indicated that documentation would be given to all employees upon the return their District Director (Director was on vacation). She has been receiving paychecks at this salary for the past 4 months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday she had a meeting with the Regional Human Resources Generalist and the new District Director. During this meeting they had indicated that payroll had made a clerical error and her salary was incorrect; she should have been receiving $47K/year instead of $55k/year. She had been receiving this salary for the past 4 months and they are now asking that she repay the difference (currently owes $3200). She was given the option to begin repayment once her maternity leave was complete and had returned to work. She told them that she would think about it and send an email confirming her decision as to when to commence repayment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe had sent an email an earlier this evening to the HRG confirming she will gladly commence repayment once her maternity leave has come to an end and is back to work. The HRG responded shortly after indicating they had made an error and the option to start repayment after her maternity leave is no longer on the table; she will need to commence repayments starting her next pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will unfortunately cause undue financial harship on our family and I am looking for help as to what our options are from a legal perspective. I feel as though she had done everything correctly and since her salary was confirmed by the Operations Manager then she should be allowed greater right or benefit and they should not be reducing her salary or requesting repayment. Even though she does not have anything in writing, we do have witnesses to the fact that the Operations Manager met with all employees to discuss their increase in salary in August and her salary was confirmed at that time. We have since created a new budget based on her new salary. I am far from knowledgable in this regard so I am looking to this wonderful community for some guidance.",

As we were going over uncle\u2019s accounts once uncle passed away, we were surprised to discover over $17k worth of charges spread over his checking and a few credit cards. I called around and quickly found out that a cousin had used those cards while he was dying in a nursing home and she continued briefly after he died, until we closed everything. She took a road trip across the country and placed charges in dozens of cities and several states. We have pressed charges in one city in which she made a big chunk of charges, but what else can we do? One credit card company will not refund the charges ($4k air bnb) because the account was closed upon uncle\u2019s death and they can\u2019t retroacfively open a fraud claim. We\u2019ve been told that we could contact each individual city in which she used the cards to press charges but it was hard enough just to file in one city. Is there anything else we can do? We have an estate lawyer but he was pretty clueless about this other than suggesting we let the credit card company open a claim for the unpaid balance and we can counter as fraud. Tldr; My husband\u2019s cousin is a terrible person who stole her dying great uncle\u2019s wallet and now we\u2019re paying for her crime. (FL)",
