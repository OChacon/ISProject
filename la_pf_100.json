        "desc": "My brother has been unknowingly committing time theft at his job for about a year to varying degrees. He is a minimum wage employee at a large retail company in NH. There have been times when he has just taken extended breaks/lunches, times when he has clocked in and remained in his car for the duration of his shift, etc. \n\nThe other day he felt as though his management was becoming suspicious of his behavior and he is now concerned about whether or not they will take legal action against him should they investigate the cameras and find out what he has been doing. He is quitting his job there (he hates it, which is what has prompted him to commit time theft in the first place) but doesn\u2019t know if this will be a red flag to his employer since it is sudden.\n\nMy brother has never committed any sort of crime in his life, he is 21 years old and a really good kid. He didn\u2019t realize that getting paid for work that was not performed is actually illegal, he thought he was simply just being lazy and found a loophole in the system somehow. His managers have never made any comments to him about any of this and he hasn\u2019t had any other issues while working there. We are just curious what the actual ramifications are should he be found out and should his employer decide to take legal action.\n\nWe think it would be pretty difficult for his employer to go through all the tapes since he has started working there to get an accurate assessment of how much money has he \u201cstolen\u201d via time theft, but do not want to rely on this as a saving grace. \n\nWould this sort of case hold up in court? Would it be charged as a regular theft or are there laws specifically pertaining to time theft? Would this be a misdemeanor or felony charge? Is he likely to receive any sort of jail time as a first offender? I also think it is important to note he feels great remorse about this and wasn\u2019t aware what he was doing was illegal (not his brightest moment). I appreciate any advice you may have.\n\nTL:DR; Brother has committed time theft at his minimum wage, retail job in the state of NH. He has never committed a crime before, been arrested, etc. What are the laws regarding time theft and what are the potential consequences he could face should his employer find out what he has been doing and take legal action?",

My father, who actually made it a point that I understood as soon as he picked me up to move in with him, he filed the paperwork with the lawyers to obtain custody and it was finalized before the end of the divorce.\n\nMy mother stated to me **yesterday** (in text messages that I have saved) that, \"..for the record, I did not steal money from you. Since I've not known where you are for 15 years, I've not had an opportunity to *repay the money I had to use to pay for my plane ticket to go to your great grandmothers funeral many years ago*.\" \n*- emphasis mine*\n\nShe wasn't my legal guardian for at least 3 years before those savings bonds matured.\n\n~~*UPDATE: It appears she cashed my savings bonds. I am not sure how to proceed since I essentially have no proof now that I had any savings bonds.*~~\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 13 and my mother guilted me into living with her.\n\nThat worked out for about a year and after quite a bit of emotional abuse/gaslighting attempts, I moved in with my dad.\n\nFast forward to 18 years old. Upon preparing for college, the savings bond in question had come up between my father and I when discussing securing money for college and loans, etc.\n\nI called my mother (father has not talked to her since the divorce, even to this day) and asked for my money and she said that I could have it when I sat down and talked to her. I refused because it seemed as though she was attempting to rope me back in to her cycle of abuse and I figured she had already spent what would've been ~$15k at full maturity of the bond so I said F it.\n\nI messaged my mother about it today and she's told me that she hasn't spent any of the money but she still won't give it to me unless I go see her.\n\nIs this something that she can rightfully do? \n\nI thought that if the savings bond was in my name, even if she was supposed to get it in my death, I'm not dead, it should be mine, right?\n\nIs this a civil suit?

The thief had to break in past a fence to do so, the other guy was lookout. There has been a rash of breakins and thefts on this street over the last few months, so it's likely the same guys. They are both fairly recognizable homeless guys hanging around the same city block and I guess theyve graduated from panhandling scams and harassing people to outright breaking and entering/theft. \n\nI called it in, told them the guys are still there, and luckily got a prompt response from the police. I gave them my account, and as luck would have it several witnesses came forward too and corroborated. They gave independent similar accounts and accused the same guy with the same description. They cops were condescending and unhelpful. Then the craziest thing of all, the perp just saunters right back to the crime scene. I was taken aback, and immediately pointed him out. The cops spent the next hour questioning him, he denied everything, and talked his way out of it. Im guessing what he did was either ditch the package somewhere to come back later, or open it, decide he didnt want whatever was in there and leave it somewhere near the house. The cops ended up letting him go, idk why, i'm guessing because it was essentially a he said/she said.\n\nDuring this entire episode, my face was very visible to the thief's homeless friends, and I was very clearly the main guy spearheading the arrest and accusation. Now im getting harassed by his buddies when im outside, note his buddies didnt do anything that I saw, but I can tell they are all part of the same network of thieving lowlifes. I know its targeted harassment. \n\nI'm not sure what to do, in the first incident the cops just let the robber go, and they were pretty condescending to me even when I had corroborating witnesses to my account.

I have around $3000 saved up in my savings account where I receive like a 0.50 APY. I know that is a terrible amount but unfortunately I am unable to switch to a different credit union. I currently have no living expenses as my parents are extremely generous to cover those, and I attend university on a full scholarship.

Maybe I'm just ill-informed and naive about that perspective though. I do not have any upcoming expenses and don't \"need\" to spend any of my money for a long time.

    "a252h5": {
        "desc": "Hey PF,\n\nSo I thought I would share some helpful ways to save money and ways to optimize your spending.\n\nThe first way (and the best way) to save money is by lowering your expenses by developing a budget.  You might be surprised to see how much you are paying for some expenses. Some popular websites include YNAB, Mint, and Personal Capital. I personally just use Mint, I just like the format and I find it easy to track my day to day expenses as well as any debt you have. As far as some advice if paid bi-weekly I would recommend budgeting based upon 2 pay periods per month rather than taking your bi-weekly paycheck \\* 26 (pay periods per year) / 12 to come up with your monthly income. If you budget based upon 2 pay periods instead of your monthly income, you will be able to treat your 2 extra paydays a year as a \"bonus\" (when you have 3 pay periods in one month). Take a look to see what expenses seem higher than you thought, see if there are ways to reduce them.\n\nBuild an emergency fund, first aim for 1,000 initially and then after paying off the debt you can look to build up the EF up more (3-6 months expenses). This [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) does show you the steps to help you reach your goals.\n\nWith all the excess, unallocated money, you should start to pay down your non-mortgage debt. The \"best\" way to pay the least amount of debt is by paying off your debt with your highest interest rate and working your way down to the lowest.  If you are someone who needs to see the immediate improvement and see debts getting paid off, then paying the debts from the lowest balance to the highest might be the best route for you. This might not be the best way to save the most money, but you can more easily knock off lower debts and you can use that as motivation to continue paying off the debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional ways to earn more money (money in the bank or through spending)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake a look at where you bank. Are you banking at a nationwide company or are you banking with a local bank/Credit union? Are you paying fees based upon your balance? Are you paying fees if you take your money out of an ATM that is not your bank?  You should look to see how much you are being charged to keep your money in the bank also you should look to how much interest you are earning on your money. There are a lot of banks and credit unions other there that don't charge fees or give you interest rates up to 3%+ (make sure to read the fine print). I open look over [Deposit Accounts](https://www.depositaccounts.com/checking/reward-checking-accounts.html) every once in a while to see if there are any changes or higher rates out there. I bank at Lake Michigan Credit Union and earn 3% on balances up to 15K, which comes out to $450 per year in interest. I also get $10 refunded for ATM fees (if I do not use the ATM at the bank). I house a good portion of my \"emergency fund\" within the checking account. Itself. You can also use the same website for the best rates for [Savings Accounts](https://www.depositaccounts.com/savings/) (make sure to review the terms of the savings account for limits for deposits and withdrawals) or even [CD Accounts](https://www.depositaccounts.com/cd/) (just set the term and possible penalties). Don't just \"settle\" for a big bank, explore your options.\n\nOnce you have stopped paying interest and started earning interest from your money in the bank, the next way you can earn money is through credit cards (Make sure to pay the debt off in full every month, the 2%-6% you might earn is not worth paying interest of 25%). You can either focus on Cash Back or Travel Points, personally, I just like to look at the cash back, as I like to just like to redeem my points for cash instead of travel. [This website](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/earning-cashback/best-cash-back-credit-cards-for-every-category222723218/) is a great resource that breaks down the best cards for each category. From your budget, you can see the areas where you spend the most money and work your way down the list to the smallest category. The Citi Double cash card is an easy way to get 2% cash back on everything, most cards get you 1% back, so it is the best \"everything\" card, but you can get cards for 6% on groceries, 5% on Gas, 5% on Amazon or Target, or 4% on eating out. You have to determine if it is \"worth\" you to get another credit card to pay for the specific category.\n\nI have the American Express Blue Cash Prefered (6% groceries, 3% Department Stores, 3% Gas) Uber Credit Card (4% eating out, 3% on Airfare and Hotel, $50 Statement credit on streaming services if you spend enough, $600 cell phone coverage if you pay the phone bill through the credit card, Discover IT 5% revolving categories, Amazon Prime Credit Card 5% Amazon, Citi Double Cash 2% everything). I could continue to go deeper with the credit cards, but the additional gains were minimal.\n\nThese are the ways that you can have your money in your bank do work for you and how you can earn additional cash back on your day to day spending.\n\nIf you are trying to save money on a mortgage, make sure you shop around.  Don't just default to using your current bank that you have. I would suggest looking for a [local broker shop](https://findamortgagebroker.com/homeowner-homebuyer) to find the best rate and price, this also helps support local business. They have the ability to shop across multiple different lenders to find a solution to your current needs compared to being stuck with what the bank gives you. ALSO more times then not, you will get a better rate with your current bank IF you go through a broker shop (for example if you bank at Chase, you will get a better rate if the broker goes through Chase then going directly through chase). Now there are exceptions to the rule, especially if you are a private client, you very likely might get a better rate but you should still shop around. Also just as far as mortgage credit pulls within 14 days count as 1 inquiry.\n\nLoyalty might help with mortgages (if you have a lot of assets with the institution), but the same does not apply to Insurance. Again you should look at your current coverage and shop around every 3-5 years. You might see the rates slowly creep up. Which is why it is important to shop around. I don't have a great source for Insurance, the only one I found is [this one](https://www.trustedchoice.com/about-us/carriers/), but it doesn't necessarily get everyone one in your area. I might rely on google maps to find a local one. Try to avoid going to insurance companies that do a bunch of commercials, as you are paying for their advertising\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Fixed a couple of typos. Added part about Mortgages and Insurance, I forgot to originally add.",

It took him three attempts before we both drove to where the right car was located, and I was getting frustrated with him and the dealership for the long wait and lack of communication. \n\nThe third time he disappeared I took a private call on my cellphone while sitting at the guest chair in front of his desk. This was 25-30 feet from the front desk. I also talked with the two people sitting 10 feet to my left as they appeared to be waiting as well. They complained about the long wait and that the salesperson wasn\u2019t communicating with them why he was taking so long. I voiced my concerns with the salesperson I was dealing with. I told them that I had been waiting a long time and that the salesperson kept leaving without telling me where he was going.\n\nAt that moment the salesperson reappeared and told me were now going to drive in another car to the one I wanted to test drive. This was two miles down the road. While on the way he asked if I had gotten all of the information I needed. I asked what he meant, and he told me he had heard everything I had said. I in turn asked if he was referring to my conversation with the online representative, whether by phone or email. He said he wasn\u2019t. I asked if he was referring to my conversation with the front desk, and he said he wasn\u2019t. He then told me he was referring to my conversation with the other customers next to me while he was away. I asked him what he meant, and he said he had recorded everything and was letting me know. \n\nI was not made aware that my private conversations would be recorded while he was away. I then also began recording (\\~ two minutes after he told me he had recorded us) for a record of the remainder of my visit. Upon completing the test drive I spoke with the manager who claimed he was not aware of any recording and that it is of course not permitted. The salesperson claimed to not know what I was talking about when questioned by the manager. I stopped recording after this conversation had ended and had left the building. I also very loudly alerted the other customers I had been speaking with (I did so in front of the front desk staff). I don\u2019t have a recording of the salesperson admitting to me that he had recorded my conversation. Am I able to report this or should I seek legal counsel?",

        "desc": "I lurk on this sub almost daily but I never felt like I have anything to contribute so I never created an account. After browsing this sub for a while, I see a disturbingly common pattern: very young people with massive amounts of debt. I gotta admit, before finding this sub debt was a foreign concept to me. I did not even know one can rack up so much debt. I thought, yeah, maybe a couple thousand but hundreds?! So here\u2019s some background. \n\nI am 22, married, no children and we are child free so none in the future either. Both me and my husband have a Bachelor\u2019s degree, I plan on going to grad school but I want my employer to pay for it so I have to wait 6 more months to become eligible. We live in the PNW, a very HCoL, and currently rent an apartment. Long term goal is to buy a house (obviously) since we anticipate living here for the foreseeable future. Ok so, here\u2019s the financial part. My parents immigrated from Russia here when I was a toddler. I was incredibly fortunate (now I realize I was, after talking to friends/coworkers whose parents were awful) to have wonderful parents who educated me, taught me how to manage money healthily, and paid for my college. Because in Russia there was no such thing as credit cards or debts, my parents successfully resisted the temptation to rack up debt in the US. They always used the money they had in hand. They have one credit card each for building history but that one gets a $10 charge a month. They bought their cars in cash, house in cash, everything. I grew up thinking this is normal and how everyone lives. Well, I had a shock when I started to hear about friends at uni that were 19 and already $10k in debt, excluding student loans. I was flabbergasted. \n\nBoth me and my husband have several credit cards to collect rewards but manage them very, very carefully. It is SO EASY to slip into debt. Just as an example, a while ago we were looking to buy a new couch and set a budget of $400. Saw a nice one for $750 and thought \u201coh, why not. Pay day is next week so we can out this on credit and pay it back next week\u201d. We almost did it. Then I shook myself out of it and realized I was about to go $350 over budget and use money I did not have in that moment. Yeah, sure, I got my paycheck later in the week but I did not want to fall into the hole of buying stuff without having immediate funds available to cover it. This is how easy it is to slip even after years of living debt free. \n\nNow don\u2019t think we live frugally. Not at all. Despite our young age and the fact that neither of us works in tech/IT, we make $100k combined per year. We enjoy life and are very happy. After retirement, health insurance, and taxes we have around $5,500 net/mo. I saw people here are very against leasing cars but we do lease our vehicle and do not regret it one bit! Driving a new, clean, beautiful car brings us joy and I\u2019m happy to throw $600/mo towards what makes us happy. Other than the car, we spend our extra income on traveling around the world. We don\u2019t have hobbies and we eat out maybe once a month at most because we love cooking at home. One other thing that we spend larger amounts of money on are clothes and shoes. We work with people in a professional setting so appearance is very important and we also like wearing good quality things.\n\nOur income is pretty average for our area, we\u2019re far from being wealthy but we live a nice, cushy life, I would say. Why? Because we adhere to some simple but golden principles. This is what my parents taught me and I can\u2019t thank them enough. My husband confessed that he was about to get into credit card debt and student loans shortly before we met and that I \u201csaved\u201d him, haha. I have coworkers who casually tell me they are $120k in debt and it makes my head spin. Here are my simple rules: \n\n1. Never spend money you don\u2019t have! Ever! Maybe I\u2019m taking it too literally but in general, do not buy stuff thinking, \u201coh, I\u2019m gonna get paid next week so it\u2019s okay\u201d. Maybe it is okay but that mindset is very dangerous and will open the door to debt. \n2. Do not take out fortunes in student loans. I went to an Ivy League on a scholarship and partly on my parents\u2019 dime. But you don\u2019t have to go to a $$$ school. Go to a community college for undergrad. \n3. Stop eating out. Not everyone likes or knows how to cook but everything is learnable! You don\u2019t have to cook Chef-like meals. Start small and work from there, it will save you more than you can think of. \n4. Make your own coffee. Yes, it\u2019s just a few hundred $ per year but it\u2019s still dragging you down. There are so many coffees out there that you can literally drink a different one every week. \n5. Do not give in peer pressure. You\u2019ll see coworkers, friends and family spending like crazy money they don\u2019t have and think you should too. Don\u2019t. Follow rule 1. \n6. Lastly, make sure your SO is on the same page. Thankfully, my husband is. If your SO is not committed to the same principles, you\u2019ll to rowing against the current. \n\nI hope this helps someone out there that is contemplating racking up debt. Now, I need some advice, too. It\u2019s painfully clear we won\u2019t be able to buy a house in cash in this crazy market, ever. We want to have $100k for a down payment (currently at 70% of goal completion) and finance the rest. We\u2019re not trying to come to terms to the fact that we will go from zero debt to hundreds of thousands. So, my question is, is a mortgage considered actual debt? In this area, houses are crazy expensive and they appreciate quite nicely over time. Thanks. ",

        "topComment": "I get where you're coming from. I've also barely ever had any debt. (Credit cards that you pay off at the end of the month are still debt, so yes, you and I both have debt on that front. I have a mortgage on my house, that's debt. I also had a car loan for a few months at one point so I could goose my credit score and get a better mortgage rate.)\n\nBut I also try not to be too high and mighty about it, particularly with respect to student loans. I'm in the same boat as you on the education front: I went to a top caliber college, paid for by scholarships, my parents, and taking advantage of AP credits to graduate early. But in retrospect, even if I needed to borrow every dollar of my educational costs, it would have been well worth it. Between the stuff I learned (both in the classroom and from my peers), the credential effect that's come from having a top school on my resume, and the network I built, compared to a cost-optimized community-college-to-state-university route, my college education EASILY would have paid for itself in my first few years out of school.\n\nI think many of your points are valid in principle, but I suspect you lost a large part of your intended audience when they got to the \"parents ... paid for my college\" part of your post. Having parents who paid for your education doesn't disqualify you from the discussion, but it is something you need to address if you want people to take the rest of your points seriously.\n\nMany people were not as fortunate as you or me. Ask yourself what you would have done if your parents couldn't pay for college. Would you really have turned down an ivy league education and gone to a community college, as you recommended in your post? I think there are arguments to be made in either direction, but if you truly believe that an ivy league education isn't worth the money if it involves going into debt, that's a thesis that merits some defending.\n\nA similar empathetic mindset would be beneficial on many of the other points, as well. Take \"Never spend money you don\u2019t have! Ever!\". If you've got a treatable cancer but not enough money to pay for treatment, it's obvious that you should still get treated, even if it means going into debt. If you see a shiny bauble in the window of a jewelry store, but don't have enough money to pay for it, it's obvious that you should not buy it. In between those two extremes there's a whole spectrum of wants vs needs, and different people calibrate their \"this is worth going into debt for\" point differently. I think your point on (1) (and, to be fair, you do add a caveat) is really something more to the effect of \"I think most people need to adjust the point on the wants vs needs scale where something is worth going into debt.\" Again, this is a point that you could expound upon.",

        "desc": "I am a 22 yo recent college graduate with about 45k in student loans. The state that I live in has created a home-buying program that would forgive student loans up to 15% of the price of the home, at a max of 40k. But all of the student loans that remain have to be paid off before buying the home. I'm aggressively paying off my student loans (1300/month) while also contributing to my retirement accounts (401k: 200/month, Roth IRA/month: 400) and saving a portion of my paycheck (400/month deposited directly to savings.. I'm living at home, so I don't have many expenses (besides groceries, car payment, car insurance, gas, and helping my mom out with bills occasionally).\n\nBecause this home-buying program would significantly reduce the amount of time I spend paying off my student loans, I want to participate, but I want to pay off enough so that I can comfortably afford my mortgage payments. My goal is to reduce my student loan balance to about 25,000 or less before participating in this program. I also want to aggressively save for a down payment at the same time so that I can put a decent amount down (I currently have approx 10k in savings, 3k in emergency fund). \n\nI've also been questioning whether buying a home is right for me because I'm not sure I want to be tied to one location at such a young age, but I will need to move out soon anyway (my commute to work is about an hour each way and living at home has become draining) and I feel as though the student loan forgiveness is too good of an opportunity to pass up. Worst case scenario and I decide to move out of the home, I hope that I can still use it as a rental property. Another motivation to buy is that my parents don't own a home and I want them to have somewhere to live when they retire. I hope to pay off this mortgage as soon as I can so that I can give it to them when I move into my \"forever home\"\n\nMy main question is: should I put off investing for retirement to put more towards my student loans and down payment? Is buying a home the right decision for me? I know how important it is to save for retirement at a young age and don't want to miss that opportunity. My 401k doesn't have a match until you've been working for my company for at least a year, and I've only been there about 6 months. I emailed the office responsible for the home-buying program, and they told me the Governor is expected to request more funding to extend the program in July 2019. The program will end when funding runs out, so I feel as though if I go through with this I'll have to be ready by this time next year at the latest.",

I am living with family with very little personal debt and incredibly low rent. I'm looking for advice on making the most of this situation while it lasts.\n\nI am making a net of roughly $800 a check, twice a month. I have a rough budget that goes as follows (per paycheck):\n\n$200 to rent (paid each check)\n\n$ 50 to gas (family provides transportation atm)\n\n$100 to debt ($300 PayPal credit)\n\n$ 50 to tmobile (paid final check of the month, $100 a month)\n\n$200 to savings \n\n$200~ leftover\n\nThat last $200 is used for extra expenses (uncertain gas for another vehicle, toiletries and other needs i.e. food) and personal use (hobbies and junk food etc...). It won't always be spent in its entirety between checks, either, and I plan to get a handle on tracking my spending more accurately for these less consistent expenditures.\n\nThe $100 debt payment will go into savings when PayPal is paid off, bringing my total savings to $300 twice monthly. I'm currently saving for a car, with a longer term goal currently uncertain (some hangups about the natural goal of my own place).\n\nSo I suppose my question is, is this a logical budget for now? How might I budget the final 1/4 more... certainly? It will likely change drastically after I get a car, with gas and insurance payments among other things.\n\nI feel I could save more by cutting into the \"discretionary\" 1/4 of my income, but that would come with a few risks. I would have less to handle emergency expenses without dipping into savings, and it would be a personal burden on my mental health having no true discretionary money.\n\nI am not at any immediate or known risk of my situation changing for the worse currently, either.

        "desc": "Long time LA reader here, and I'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. When I'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.\n\nEarly in November we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend I'll call Aaron (because his name's Aaron and I think he's being an idiot) had bought on eBay. We had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.\n\nIt'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.\n\nAaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.\n\nAaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down & helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.\n\nWe phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.\n\nI think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?\n\n",

The delivery driver pulled up to the front of the house on the road, stepped over the curb and snow, and walked to our front porch area.

He agreed and cancelled the ambulance and I took his car and helped him get into the building and then I walked home. He was very grateful to me and a nice man, no mention of whether or not he believed this was our fault. \n\nNow, it should be noted that my driveway was not plowed, but it was enterable.

Now we just hang on to the card for when we have to buy from Lowe's and want to save 5% in-store. We never rack up debts on it, so it is paid off.\n\nThe other card is a Chase Freedom Unlimited. We use this for groceries, gas, and any large expenses, but also pay it off immediately  so we never accumulate debt or have to pay interests (it is still in its 0% interest phase right now, though).\n\nI have been thinking about a Kroger card because of the \"save 25 cents per gallon when redeeming 100 points\" benefit.

        "desc": "Hi,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have several questions on my mind related to housing, savings (401k), etc that I'm going to ask. I've done some online research but I would appreciate if anyone could provide any insight into my particular situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to be starting my first job in February in a small company located in downtown Seattle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest concern right now is finding housing, so I was hoping for advice on how much I'm able to spend and also on methods of finding one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy salary will be 110k a year. I will be given a 20k sign on bonus but I'm going to do my calculations without the bonus in mind as I would like directly save/invest that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing a take-home-pay calculator online, it says an income of 110k correlates to 81k after tax. Is this correct? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn regards to housing, I was wondering if I'm able to afford living in a studio downtown for 2k a month. In a year that would be 24k, which is 30% of my take-home salary. I've heard from some people that the most you want to be paying is around 25%, so I'm not sure. I would like a shorter commute so I would really like to live downtown, but the only other way to lower my housing expense seems to either live farther away, or live with roommates. I'm actually very willing to live with a roommate or two if it would lower my rent, but it also seems quite difficult to find an appropriate arrangement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sort of leads to my next problem which is actually finding an apartment. I can either try finding a place before February on Craigslist or something, but I've heard another method may be better. The company is providing 5k for relocation, so I was wondering if I should spend a month in an airbnb or something, and then look for an apartment while I'm there? The downside of this seems to be that the airbnb will likely be quite expensive and I also will kind of be in a scramble to find an apartment because I'll be doing all the searching once I'm already there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn regards to budgeting for IRA/savings, I had a question because my employer does not match any 401k. Since this is the case, should I still try to max out both my Roth IRA and 401k? To be honest, I'm not sure if I can afford to with my current income and after deducting my housing expenses. But if I do have some income left over, is the best place to spend it on just towards maxing my 401k despite no matching? Or should I save it and invest in the S&P 500 or something. I'm very new both to budgeting and investing if you may have noticed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, since I've never actually lived alone, I'm not sure how far 81k will take me. I will look into creating a monthly budget but I guess a lot of factors, such as housing, aren't currently determined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, I would appreciate any and all advice.",

        "topComment": "A lot of people have given advice about living outside of Seattle to save money, but if your budget is up to $2k and you'd also like a shorter commute I think it's best to stay within the city limits. People who live outside the city tend to underestimate the value of the light rail we have! If your work place is downtown (or anywhere in the area that is west of I5/south of Queen Anne/north of the international district), living off the lightrail could give you an easy 10-20min commute. I have lived in Beacon Hill and Mt Baker which are two south neighborhoods that have their own light rails stations that people tend to look over. I save some money living out here but I can easily walk 10mins to the light rail and then it's a short 15min ride into the city. The more money you have the closer you can get to the light rail and the easier your commute becomes! For a trendier/more exciting neighborhood I would look at Capitol Hill which also has its own light rail station.\n\nBottom line is you can absolutely save a good chunk of money by living outside the city, but you are giving up a not insignificant portion of your day to commuting if you live somewhere like Everett/Bremerton/Renton.

In return, Mr. Belvedere agreed to pay rent during the duration of our marriage, so that I could pursue other career paths. Since I am in professional burnout & he wants a Green Card, it seemed like a good quid pro quo agreement.\n\nMr. Belvedere initially entered the US with an H-1B Visa from London to work in software sales. Mr. Belvedere said he moved a year after meeting and long distance dating his company\u2019s US female counterpart (I\u2019m gay, he\u2019s straight). He said upon moving that he soon learned that she had been cheating on him the whole time and they broke up. He also departed from the software company after an acquisition & \u201cculture change\u201d (I\u2019m not sure who initiated the departure, I\u2019m guessing the company).\n\nWhen Mr. Belvedere & I made our agreement, he had a E2 Visa for a real estate LLC he started that had 7 months out of the 2 years remaining. I had known Mr. Belvedere for approximately 5 months by that point. We set a wedding date for 4 months later. Two months into the \u201cengagement\u201d he asked if I would agree to waiting until he had the proper work permits to begin pay the entirety of the rent. He said once he had the right documentation that he could return to software sale and would make $175K again. Prior to his request, Mr. Belvedere would often portray his family as emotionally abusive & physically abusive during childhood; although our relationship was not sexual he had also became flirtatious & alluded to possible bisexuality, so a combination of emotions including friendship, career burnout, sympathy, and sexual ambiguity factored into my decision to agree with the delay in him upholding his end of the agreement.\n\nWhen Mr. Belvedere & I made our agreement, he had a E2 Visa for a real estate LLC he started that had 7 months out of the 2 years remaining.

It turns out his motives for this behavior was to gather evidence that he was a victim of domestic violence in the form of financial abuse, a variation of emotional abuse.

I have no debts or loans, or costly living expenses.\n* $7k in a savings account (I have not been adding anything to this account recently, hopefully I can now).\n* $3-4k in my checking account.\n* I pay my credit card bills on time and monitor my spending which is around $200 per month that includes food/gas.\n* My job offered me $34k (Yes, I know some of you might say that is considerably low for a Master's degree, but I work in a nonprofit).\n\nI would like a place of my own, but my work is 15-20 minutes away from my parent's house, and it's very convenient. \n\nI hope to move up at my job, but I also keep a look out on bigger and better opportunities with better pay. I just started this job so we'll see how it it goes. \n\nThe real question I have is retirement accounts. My job offers a 403 B through MassMatual.\n\n* Employee match: 0-5 years of service = 5%, 6-10 years years of service = 6%, 10+ years of service = 7%\n* Vesting (I'm not entirely sure how this works): 2 years = 25%, 3 years = 50%, 4 years =75%, and 5 years = 100%\n* No loans offered within this plan, hardship withdrawals available\n* Will include a Roth option with plan investments\n\nI'm not sure how much to contribute, of if I should even have a retirement fund with my work. I've heard of just opening my own Roth IRA, but again, I'm unsure. \n\nA little advice or any help is appreciated! Thank you!",

If you're still comfortable contributing more money, just up the percentage you contribute to the 403 B.\n\nIf you enjoy living with your parents and its convenient,  I would say to stay.  Don't move out just because you think its something you should do.  You are certainly saving money, and it will give you flexibility if you do actually have to move for work in the future, because you wont be tied to a lease.",

        "desc": "This happened two years ago. I had a good friend (I\u2019m a guy, she\u2019s a girl). We were all part of the same group of friends and did things together. After one night of going out, we all came back to my roommate and I\u2019s apartment. People took spots on the sofas, ground etc to sleep. I went to my room to sleep after handing out sheets and blankets. Sometime in the very early am, I stir a little and notice someone next to me. This person snuggles in as I\u2019m trying to figure out who is encroaching, and by piecing together the hair and whatever features I can see, I figure out its her. I\u2019m a little taken aback, and she notes that I\u2019ve now moved and am awake. She begins to kiss me, I kiss back, we have sex. We fall asleep. We wake up, don\u2019t say a word, and she asks if I can give her a ride back to hers. So I do.\n\nThis happens a few more times (I think 3-4 total) over the course of a month with some variation. Once she knocks on my door at night and from the doorway asks if she can sleep in my bed because the couch is uncomfortable. I say yes knowing what\u2019s happening, and it goes as predicted. \n\nBy the 3rd or 4th time we have been intimate at her initiation, she wants to talk about what\u2019s happening and wants to be FWB. \n\nI\u2019m uncomfortable with the idea because we are good friends, from the same group, I\u2019m not particularly attracted to her, and I\u2019m also very anxious about relationships and intimacy. \n\nSo that gets shut down. Probably a month or two later, it happens twice again. After the second time I tell her I don\u2019t want this happening again. She is disappointed and confused, and says that she took my responsiveness as interest. I admit that my actions don\u2019t align with what I\u2019ve said on two occasions, and that we should both uphold our ends of the deal.\n\nSo far so good. We never hook up again.\n\nEveryone in our group knows the story and was keeping up with it in real time. \n\nThing is, a few months after that, she is burning bridges with everyone because she apparently lies a lot, has unpaid debt to a few of her friends and is ignoring them, is spreading people\u2019s business, taking advantage of their kindness, acting entitled to their property/presence, and is generally being a menace. I didn\u2019t know she was like this because that side never came out. But as her interpersonal relationships take on strain, they begin affecting ours too. She starts spending 10+ hours just hanging out on my couch, eating my food. Wanting to smoke weed all the time and never contributing. At the time I was also going through a rough patch, and her increasingly erratic behavior starts causing me stress. Then she does some things that anger me, and a few others, and that is it. She\u2019s out of our group. Haven\u2019t talked to her since.\n\nSince then, things have gone from bad to worse. She is one of those angry political people on Facebook, she has moved back with her toxic parents, didn\u2019t complete her degree, got a DUI, and was caught shoplifting.\n\nI have no idea what the fuck is happening with her, but I am starting to get a little worried.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you why. I apologize in advance, because tbh it makes me feel disgusting to have this thought.\n\nHaving seen NDT\u2019s response yesterday (I do not want to discuss that or metoo or anything), and then also having her pop up in a recent Facebook post...\n\nI started to wonder if she could perhaps accuse me of something in post years down the line for some reason. I never ever did anything to be guilty of such a claim (Jesus Christ, to even be typing this) and at all times was just following her advances. Tbh none of the details matter, the simple question is: How should one document the relationship and keep it saved for the future just in case? My first thought was to screenshot every text we ever exchanged (and I guarantee there\u2019s gotta be some in which we discussed the previous night, but I don\u2019t remember) but I\u2019m a fucking idiot and I deleted it off my phone. I\u2019m going to check iTunes to see if there is a backup, but idk if it saves messages. \n\nShould I get written statements from two or three friends just detailing the nature of our fling just so it is documented if the need ever arises to use it? I certainly do not think she (as I knew her) would ever do such a thing, esp considering we were both extremely liberal and supportive of causes such as metoo, but despite having seen hordes of disgusting men get their comeuppance, the NDT response has kind of put a chill in my bones (im passing no judgment on if he\u2019s guilty or innocent, ill wait for the investigation). I realized I had poorly judged someone\u2019s character, and that that person could potentially have the power to fuck me up if the desire came over them.\n\nI\u2019m just trying to be proactive and defensive. I want to do whatever I need to, and then just forget about it.\n\nWhat should I do? I will check iTunes for texts, as well as fb messenger. Assuming we exchanged messages about our consensual hookups (though to be perfectly honest I\u2019m not sure we followed the rules of consent by her entering my bed unrequested a few of those times) then there will be clear evidence of benign ONS\u2019s. If I don\u2019t have those, what\u2019s the next best option? \n\n**TL;DR: How should you document a relationship in case you need to paint a picture of it later, perhaps years down the road?**\n\nEDIT: located in southeastern United States.",

Sorry for the info dump but backstory is necessary in this case.\nMy sister (25) and her husband (24)  are separated but not divorced due to her not having any credit at all and him filing for bankruptcy. Together they have 2 children, a boy (5) and a girl (3).\nThey have been separated since June and my sister moved into an apartment with the two kids. Her new boyfriend, who is a pill addict (that replaced pills with alcohol when he can\u2019t get one fix), also moved in with her and the kids.\nMy uncle takes her son to school and watches her daughter during the day as both my sister and the bf have day jobs.\nMy uncle says the apartment is a wreck all the time, the only thing ever in the fridge is beer and milk, the dishes are never done and nothing is ever cleaned. My sister mostly just feeds her kids cereal for dinner or happy meals, and she rarely cooks. We also suspect that her and the boyfriend have had sex in front of the children because my niece tried to lick my nephew\u2019s private bits, and they wouldn\u2019t know what that is unless she had sex in front of them.\nHer husband gets the kids on the weekends. But when he has them, he will often not bathe them at all. The girl was at his house from Wednesday until Sunday and the entire time, she wore the same outfit and panties. He bathed her Sunday morning before my sister picked them up Sunday afternoon. He also rarely feeds them. The only time they eat is if he takes them out for fast food or if he dumps them on his grandparents who are in their 70s. But even then, the kids only eat maybe once per day when they are with their dad. The husband also attempted to sexually assault my sister with the kids in the same room, and said that \u201cThere\u2019s no laws against marital rape in Oklahoma.\u201d \n\nAll that being said, if I call CPS, will anything be done? Because even while my sister was with this guy,they never really parented their children. Her husband will basically beat the boy for the slightest mishap but never touches the girl and is obviously showing favoritism. My sister never disciplines them unless someone is watching. She\u2019s dating a druggie now and her husband keeps trying to get custody of the kids but neither of them are capable of being parents. I\u2019m worried that if I call, my niece and nephew will be given to my brother-in-law and his grandparents just because his grandparents have the money to fight for the kids in court, but they aren\u2019t capable of actually taking care of two young kids in their 70s. My brother-in-law literally ignored the kids whenever my sister was still with him and now that they are separated and he gets them alone, he neglects them, and my sister obviously isn\u2019t much better.\n\nIs there anything I can do? Will CPS take them away and give them to someone else?\nI would take my niece and nephew in myself but I am just their aunt and I still live with my parents until June 2019 when I get married and move out.\nI\u2019m really worried because these kids aren\u2019t being fed unless it\u2019s by third-party family members and they are being bumped between two parents who both act like they don\u2019t care about the kids at all.

You (or your attorney) do have a right to state your case to the judge, for example, why you\u2019re falling behind on payments or new circumstances that are preventing you to pay, etc. So long as you keep excellent communication with your PO, you should be in the clear.

I\u2019m not even sure this is the right subreddit, so please forgive me if this isn't the correct one. \n\nI have a couple of questions I would like answered, but they will be at the very end of this post since this will be long and complicated.\n\nLet me get basic some stuff out of the way.\n\n\\- I\u2019m a junior at a large, top ranking state university in the U.S., majoring in Environmental Management with an Agricultural focus.\n\n\\- I have numerous health issues, including, but not limited to, two liver transplants, severe hearing loss (I wear hearing aids), suppressed immune system, several auto-immune diseases, and many more.\n\n\\- My monthly medications cost about $20k, but I\u2019m on MediCare so that and everything else is covered\n\n\\- I have virtually no money saved since I was either sick or simply couldn\u2019t get a job due to my health insurance\n\n\\- Both of my parents are poor and will be helping minimally, if at all.\n\n\\- I have three sets of grandparents, two might help, but one won\u2019t be able to. However, the two that might help, while well-off, are also pretty stingy. \n\n\\- I will graduate debt-free from college thanks to online college being dirt cheap and me getting the max amount of grant money on FAFSA (enough to cover tuition, books and car insurance)\n\n\\- My grades are good but aren\u2019t great (\\~3.45 GPA after this semester), I had a really bad sophomore year with depression and overall online school is not a very good platform for me to learn. \n\n\\- By the time I graduate, I should be cited on 2-3 scientific papers, and will have about 500 hours of related experience (university soil science lab lab, AGV assembly and greenhouse) as well as about 500 hours of community service (mainly from a museum, which is where I originally wanted to work)\n\nWhen I graduate, (Spring of 2020) I will have a B.S. in Environmental Management and my university has a pretty good job placement program. However, I honestly hate the jobs my degree will comes with, I simply cannot be sitting in an office and managing people and while there is some flexibility to jobs I can find due to my pretty extensive (for an undergrad) lab experience, I also worry about finding a job where I can either:\n\na.) Pay for health insurance or \n\nb.) Can get health insurance through the job with only a B.S. from an online program.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been interested in greenhouse agriculture for a long time, and while my university that I\u2019m currently attending online has a pretty good horticulture program, it\u2019s not focused on what I want to focus on (highly automated greenhouse systems). Not to mention I abhor the town and the campus. I really want to go the University of Arizona; however, I\u2019m concerned about \n\na.)  Paying for college (which will be almost $70k by my estimates as an out of state student) \n\nb.) Getting health insurance\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I suppose the questions are: \n\n**1.) Should I pursue a graduate degree, knowing I have to switch health insurances and find all new doctors (all 9 of them)?**\n\n**2.) If so, how would I pay for it?** \n\n**3.) Assuming I\u2019m accepted, is there any way to speed up getting a new state residency since I will need that to get onto Arizona\u2019s Medicaid program (which would also cut the costs by about 50%)?** \n\nMaybe I've overthinking this, but I don't want to graduate college and start my career with $70k in debt, for someone who's been poor all their life, that number scares the bejesus out of me, but maybe it isn't that much? I know for a fact the healthcare issue is my top priority, and if I can't get healthcare, no matter if they pay me to go to college, I simply won't be able to attend. I know this is a lot, and I know the medical parts don't really belong here, but I'm about a year from applying and I simply want to explore my options and get as much info as I can.

I have two separate situations that I was hoping for advice about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) The developer kept both entrances nice an tidy with a regular maintenance plan while they were selling and building.  Now that they have moved out, the entrances look terrible and are all over grown with weeds taller than the planted landscaping.  According to the homeowners that are the first houses at the entrances, they were told by the exiting developer, that they (the homeowners on those particular lots), were now responsible for all of the upkeep.  However, those homeowners feel that they are not responsible for the up-keep and just let it all overgrow.  It now looks really bad and is probably deterring future home buyers.  Again, there is no HOA and most feel that they do not want one.   People in the neighborhood are willing to have community clean up day to work on the entrances.  My questions for this situation are... How do the people in the community working on entrance protect themselves from being sued in case of a scenario where they accidentally kill a tree/bush, or break something (masonry features), etc?  Same question for the homeowners on those pieces of property; how do they protect themselves from getting sued by the community volunteers if an accident happens?  Both sides are afraid of committing to a solution out of fear of being sued.  I am personally willing to do the work, but I am not sure how to protect myself if one of the homeowner's does not like the way I trimmed a bush or something trivial.  Any advice?  Is an HOA the only option?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Now the developer has left, lots of people are ignoring the strict covenants that the original homeowner's had to sign and agree to when the homes were built.  If I understand correctly, these covenants apply regardless of how many times the property is sold, rented, etc.  My question is, can these covenants be enforced without an HOA present, and how would they be enforced?     \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTIA",

        "desc": "Hi Reddit.\n\nBackstory: I'm 28 years old, living in the US, no debt, fairly good credit, about 20k in liquid savings and almost 8k more in stocks and a small traditional IRA. Unfortunately, while I love my job and make pretty decent money, I'm a contractor working 39 hours a week, so I don't get a 401k or anything like that.\n\nI'm not the most financially literate guy. But this year, I plan on getting serious about investing in my future. I would love to just dump a bunch of money in an IRA and/or stocks and be done with it! But the problem I keep running into is this: my faith in the long-term health of the US stock market and economy at large just isn't that high. I'm wary of pouring my savings into an overinflated stock market that won't hold its value a couple decades down the line. \n\nThat might be an overly pessimistic view. I'm not wholly against stocks (as you might guess from the 8k I already have invested) but at the very least, I don't want all my eggs in one basket. \n\nMy main question: What are my options for saving for the future, considering my low faith in the long-term health of the US economy? What can I do to diversify my assets and minimize risk, with this in mind?\n\nSecondary questions: Financially, what should I make sure to do before I turn 30? Is there anything obvious I'm missing here?\n\nI can provide more information about my situation if needed. Thank you in advance for any advice.",

        "topComment": "In provinces which use the common law, as opposed to civil law (like Quebec), medical battery is a tort - a recognized reason why a person can sue for damages. As you've inferred, it is used where surgery or treatment is given to a patient without their express consent, their consent could not be inferred, and the situation was not an emergency. It also exists where the medical practitioner has gone well beyond or departed from the procedure for which consent was given. \n\nThe last two items are important. Lets say you agree to surgery to remove a cancerous tumour and while you are on the table the surgeon notices a cyst or something else that can cause you problems or negative symptoms. You'd most likely have given consent if it had been known about in advance, and removing it now will save you a second surgery. The court might infer your consent. Also, the courts do not expect that a doctor would let you die or suffer grievance harm in an emergency situation just because you are not able to give consent (e.g. you are unconscious).\n\nIf you want to understand a bit more, you can read an actual case decision regarding medical battery. This is a blog post mean for medical professionals about a recent case: [https://www.cmpa-acpm.ca/en/advice-publications/browse-articles/2014/a-step-too-far-lessons-from-a-recent-consent-case](https://www.cmpa-acpm.ca/en/advice-publications/browse-articles/2014/a-step-too-far-lessons-from-a-recent-consent-case). In the case being described, the surgeon noticed additional problems and corrected them while doing the surgery the patient consented to, but that additional thing made it less likely the patient could have children. The surgeon knew the patient was attempting to have children and her fertility was important to her. The courts said her consent could not be inferred in that situation.\n\nHowever, this tort does not exist AT ALL in Quebec because Quebec does not use common law. Still, that does not mean that there isn't some equivalent means of redress within the civil law system.\n\n&#x200B;",

I said something along the lines of, \"Sorry, I didn't realize I even did that.\" I honestly thought I stopped for the full 3 seconds, but I guess what I did was a rolling stop, because I do know for a fact I didn't completely blow through it, and I have been known to do rolling stops when no one is around (believe me, I won't be doing that anymore).\n\nThe cop was friendly and made small talk with me about my personal life (college, work, etc). Then, he takes my license and insurance card, writes me a ticket, thanks me for my cooperation, says I'm a good person, and sends me on my way.\n\nThe price of the ticket is not my biggest concern here, although I would definitely want to get it reduced if possible. I'm more concerned about the points on my record and my insurance going up.

Saying things like \"I honestly thought I did a full stop\" implies that you feel wrongly accused and have little remorse for your mistake. Something better might be \"I made a mistake, and I'll do my best to be more diligent in the future\". You are free to ask for a reduced ticket, but don't try to sound like you feel you deserve it.\n\n2)The officer may or may not be there for your first date in court. Your first appearance is usually to plead either guilty or not guilty. If you plead not guilty, then another court date may be scheduled so you can present your case.\n\n3) The judge will act as he/she sees fit. It's possible to charge you more or less then the ticket you were given, or to change or add charges as they see fit. Respect the judges decision. After you are given your fine, you can ask for time to make your payment or for the option of a payment plan, up to the judge's discretion. \n\n4) that depends on your insurance provider, how long you've been a customer with them and what sort of policies they have.\n\nYou could also look into hiring a traffic court attorney. This could end up costing you more then the ticket, but they have a much better chance of navigating the system to get you the best possible result.",

I know nothing about investing, life insurance, etc., and am having a hard time making financially sound decisions on how to curb/remove debt.\n\nLiterally this morning I met with a consultant who helped set up our life insurance/retirement fund a couple of years ago. She brought up a new program in the BOLI market that could potentially help us expedite the process of wiping out our debts. Essentially, we need to budget and put in $1k into the BOLI each month to stimulate the compounding interest rate growth (4% currently) to be able to fast track into financial freedom. \n\nWith that being said, I know nothing about this program and need to figure out if this is the right fit for our family. We estimate that we would be able to pay off our home in about 10 to 15 years, as opposed to our 30 year fixed VA home loan, as well as wiping out all of the debts mentioned above prior to paying off the home. \n\nThe program sounds too good to be true -- so what's the catch??

Canada \n\nOn November 9th there was a domestic dispute between my now ex boyfriend (21M) and I (18F) The police labeled me as the dominant aggressor because he had visible injuries. He had these injuries because I had to try to get him off of me after he lifted me up by my neck and then almost broke my ribs. (he also lied to the police in his phone call), I was charged with assault and released on conditions, my court date is January 3rd and I have a meeting with a lawyer on the 13th of this month. After the trial (pending the result, though from the professionals I've spoken with so far, they believe mostly that the odds are in my favour), I planned on moving to a different province to honestly start my life, I'd be getting an apartment with my cousin and it's something I've really been looking forward to. \n\nHe went through the trouble of finding my backup Instagram account, sending me a dm and saying if he doesn't get his $500 back by January 1st, he's filing a small claims suit against me. A few months ago I had to quit my old job due to bad anxiety and a manager who made vulgar comments/didn't pay people. He sent me money to help me buy groceries and whatever else I needed during this time (he's claiming that amount as $500) keep in mind, we were living together at this time as well.... So the groceries and other things were for us both. \n\nHe said not to worry about paying him back, and that we could discuss it next year when I'm in a better financial situation... He has attempted to contact me multiple times, and since I haven't been responding (due to my conditions and the fact that I want absolutely nothing to do with him) that's when he finally sent that message, today. He knows about my plan to move to a different province, and I believe he's just trying to keep me trapped here. \n\nI'm 18, I work at urban outfitters. I haven't been able to work because of my bruised ribs, now increased anxiety and fear that he'll show up where I'm at. I wouldn't have $500 to give him even if I wanted to, I'm having a panic attack as I write this, I don't know what to do. I just want him to be out of my life, I just want to be free. \n",

I will use the real numbers, which are in Hungarian Forints (HUF). It has very low value against any currency. 1 EUR = 320 HUF\nYes my account is in the negative for now.\n\nSo my account had -39.398 HUF when I got the loan of 480.000 HUF.\n\nI followed this calculation:\nHe owed me 68.825 HUF. That makes me 29.427 in positive. I had some spendings which made my balance to -6498. That's it. This is where I should be personally.\n\nMy brother's calculation:\nHe starts from the 480.000. He deducts the debt towards me (68.825). He had some other spendings which makes his balance (i.e. loan) 168.171 in the positive. But the account actually has 135.803 HUF. So if he has 168.171 (from the loan) then we deduct that from the account's balance and then we get MY balance which *in this case* is -32.368 HUF. This is 25.870 HUF difference.  (~ 80 EUR, so we are not argunig over cents..)\n\nThe question is: which calculation is wrong? There is no item which has this huge amount of value. And we did not miss more items that adds up this much.\n\nAny help is appreciated. If more details needed I am more than happy to help.\n\nCheers",

However, the event that she was referring to had happened two weeks ago. Without giving too much details, my job doesn't require me to be in the office all the time. I got this warning for forgetting to let her know I was going to be working on my day off ( I completely forgot to notify her that I was going to be working on the day I'm usually off due to being a short week). She is also stating that I was not in the office and that it looked suspicious. I have been working there for more than 7 years with zero incidents, if it means anything. \n> \n>  Two weeks ago, she had talk to me about it and I apologized telling her that it was an honest mistake and took all her recommendations and made changes right away. I took it like an informal verbal warning. Two weeks later, her and the other supervisor send me an email saying that they want to meet with me in the evening. She then gives me the official  verbal warning.\n> \n> On the report, she included that  my numbers were low in sales...btw all employees numbers are low for lack of customers. However, she had already talk to me about it last month (she talked to every team member but it was not a warning) and we agreed that we would check in January and that they were expecting my sales to go up. I agreed and my sales have improve. My question is why would she would add this to this verbal warning? they didn't even pull my new numbers but I been keeping track of them and I know they have gone up.\n> \n> On top of that, she lied during the meeting, both verbally and on the official verbal warning. She said I had confessed to something which is false. But not only that, she also said that my close coworker had also said the same thing I \"confessed\" to. I told her right to the her face that I did not believe she would make such a statement.

        "desc": "My wife of 20 years passed away last month. I've been slowly coming to grips with it but there are some financial decisions I need to be prepared make soon. This is one of them. \n\nWe had a small Roth IRA set up for her a few years ago with a small amount contributed every month. Now that she is gone what are my options for this account? Total amount in it is about $25k or so from the last quarterly update we saw.\n\nI have a new job now (started two weeks before she passed) and make substantially more than I did previously. That amount represents 2-3 months of my new takehome pay in a LCOL area so I'm fine. So I'm considering passing it on to her two grown children who need the money far more than I do. I'm already planning to split the life insurance (around $40k) between them. That would be a life changing sum for each of them if they set it aside as an emergency fund to give them freedom, or invested in their future somehow. (Edit: it would be about one years salary for each of them)\n\nBut I don't know the tax implications of dealing with this Roth. I made almost all the income during the time we had it -- she only worked a couple years for pay during the time she had the Roth, the rest was volunteer work up to the day she passed. So all the payments into it were essentially mine with the tax already paid up front, withdrawn from a joint bank account we've held all along. \n\nWhat are my options for dealing with this Roth IRA? If I can cash it out will I be required to pay tax on it again since it was her Roth even though it was my income paying into it? Or will her kids? (my understanding is it would be a gift so no taxes paid by them but I want to be sure)\n\nAnything else I need to be aware of? Pitfalls? Other better ideas? Suggestions? This is all uncharted territory for me. \n\nAlso don't worry I'm not making any major financial decisions emotionally. I know this is a common concern. Just want to know what the options are so I can potentially give them a large gift from her which is what she always wanted, to provide for them more than she was able to before. She had a very hard life and was supposed to finally be able to relax now that we hit the easy times. I'm going to honor that. They have no idea any of this is coming so I'm looking forward to being able to honor her wishes. \n\n**edit:** Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to respond. Your advice and thoughts are all appreciated. \n\nSummary of what I've got so far:\n\n-\tThere are ways to deal with the Roth that will not involve any taxes. I can cash it out (through a process) and hand them a lump sum each or create a Roth for each of them. (unlikely I will do that as that doesn't help them now)\n-\tDon't try to control them, just tell them to honor their moms wishes -- \"what would mom say?\" is great advice.\n-\tGive insurance as lump sum for emergency fund, keep Roth for myself since I don't have one, and instead pay them each $500/month for 2 or so years (so about $25k) out of my own income to help stabilize their monthly income, get education/training etc. I am starting to really like this idea because it gives them a windfall but also spreads money out, and my wife would also like kickstarting my own Roth. Still need to think through it though. \n-\tTalk to each one when I'm ready to start and see if they would prefer a lump sum or monthly payments. So an individualized plan for each. One may want the lump sum of the insurance while the other wants it over a year or two or three or whatever. And I could still do the monthly in lieu of the Roth payout. This tailors it to each. If they take the monthly I can keep the remainder in a separate account and give them the balance each month so there is full transparency. \n-\tTry to structure things such that they need to take some financial planning courses before they can receive the money. (One of them works nights and so sleeps almost all day, the other works all day 6 days a week and is also taking a certification class several nights a week, so this might be difficult for them to do anytime soon, but I'll look into it since it is good advice)",

        "desc": "Background info: \nWe were married for three years (2015-2018) and the last year we officially separated while I was abroad working (2017-2018). In the beginning of our marriage we took out a car which I gave a down deposit ($10k) and he agreed he would pay the remaining 2/3s. I drove the car from 2015-2017, and he had the car from 2017-2018 when I was abroad. Since I was still in graduate school, and he had a full time job, the credit for the vehicle was approved under his name (summer 2015). In the summer of 2018, we decided it would be best to divorce under amicable terms and we both agreed I would keep the car and he would keep all his 401K/Savings and I would receive no alimony/support/health insurance in return. Just to clarify, I told him I didn't want the car but he insisted because he didn't want to financially support me except for the car. The court documents reflect that.\n\nHowever, several weeks ago, my ex contacted me and said that we owed X amount on the car note and that next year, he wants to change the car title to my name, and tells me that I need to take out a personal loan to finish paying the car. I am still in graduate school after a year of no income because I was doing field work abroad and looking for jobs at the moment. I can't afford or even be approved for a personal loan at this point since 1) I didn't have income from 2017-2018 when I was doing my field work abroad, 2) my monthly salary barely covers my four walls, and 3) my graduate school salary ends in June with my university since I am suppose to graduate in August. \n\nBesides, I feel misled that he agreed to take care of the car and now he wants me to pay the remaining balance or force me to sell the car. I am in Texas where the divorce took place, the documents just state I get the car and we each keep our debt. I offered to pay between $200-$300 each month to help him but he wants me to take the debt in full. I may have messages in writing where he states he would pay off the car/insisted for me to take the car but I wanted to hear your take/experience on this. \n\nEmotionally, I feel very unsettled since I am aggressively looking for jobs and my income is 4x less than what he currently makes. I guess I would feel better once I get a job in my field post-graduation but I am very concerned right now that I am still applying for jobs. I also want to be fair with him and not stop him from doing anything that hinders his happiness, but he also agreed to this term because it worked best for him at the time. I am just trying to be as logical as possible and not get my feelings in the way. \n\nOur car is upside down, so if we happen to sell it, we would owe money on it and I would have no means of transportation. \n\nThank you in advance!

More generous than they usually are but then there are not very many people who could do the job.  \n\n\nCouple of weeks go by and it turns out I was \"supposed\" to have only been offered $30. What I agreed to with the manager was take the pay cut initially and figure the rest out when the owner got back from Hawaii. What happened was the manager took the difference out of my following check. \"You can't just expect to be paid extra, that's not how it happens!\" I signed a fucking contract that's exactly how it happens. I wouldn't have taken the damn job for $30/hr, my rank and file fabrication job pays more than that and comes with union benefits. No I did not ever sign an amended contract they just started paying me less.  \n\n\nI pointed out that the manager lied to and stole from me and the owner fired me. This is all kinds of illegal, yeah? My dumb self didn't get a copy of the contract at the beginning but I have my pay and timeclock records and texts mentioning the rate, unless they're willing to try and forge a document they'll have to bring the original to court. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this a matter for small claims or should I get an attorney?

        "desc": "This is a repost of something I posted in r/ebay.\n--------------\nI sold a $400 laptop about a week ago. It shipped to a New Jersey address. About a day after confirmed delivery, the buyer opened a return request, claimed the box was filled with garbage (literally) and demanded a refund.\n\nI allowed them to return the box - which I guess was a huge mistake. Indeed I was shipped back a box filled with garbage.\n\nI then opened up the transaction to look a little closer. It turns out the buyer is in the Ukraine, and the address they had me ship to (NOT the address registered to the ebay account) is, when googled, a reshipping company in America that is associated with hundreds of reports of fraud. Most are nearly identical to my situation: a person in Ukraine or Russia who claims an item is not as described or never received. In many cases people report that it turns out the ebay account used was hacked/stolen.\n\nThe ebay account in question was opened in 2011 but has only 4 feedback, with no real recent activity, which lends itself to the idea that it was probably stolen or hacked. The name of the account is also a real person's name, very different from the name of the buyer (not the real names, but like the ebay account is named \"Jerry_Smith123\" but the package went to \"Vladamir Brovslakskow\".)\n\nSo, thinking I have an open and shut case here, I called ebay to ask them to investigate the buyer (who has already left me negative feedback, by the way.) The first person I talk to puts me on hold to investigate the issue, spends about 5 minutes doing that, and comes back and says she absolutely agrees that it is a clear cut and dry case of fraud that should be easy to resolve. She says she needs to put me through to a different department (I don't remember what it was, but it was NOT Trust & Safety).\n\nThe woman in that department also puts me on hold to investigate. Then she comes back and says that because I accepted the return, if I am claiming what was returned to me is not what I mailed out, I will have to file a police report to continue a more in-depth investigation that can take up to 10 days.\n\nSo I'm thinking...are you serious? It's so cut and dry! And she says she agrees that it is very obviously fraud, and that the buyer is not entitled to a claim because claims are void if you use a third party shipping company, but because I already accepted the return, the only way to proceed is with a police report.\n\nSo the next day I went in to the police station to file a report. It took forever, and I finally sat down with a detective. After explaining the situation he said there is really nothing that they can do. He says because the person in question is located in a foreign country, it would be handled by the FBI or even Interpol, but that they would not be taking a report.\n\nSo I call eBay again, and the new rep says if that is the case, I need to call eBay while I am at the station and then ask the officer to speak to the eBay representative while I have them on the phone. So I went back to the station, and I was allowed to see the same detective. I told him this and he said no. Flat out, he said he's not going to do it.\n\nSo what in the hell am I supposed to do at this point?",

I have been living in this place now for just over two weeks. In those two weeks, he has entered my place without notice on seven occasions. We had signed the for me to move in on a particular day. He requested a couple of extra days to put tile in the bathroom (he was putting tile in the bedrooms and figured it would be easy to do the bathroom).\n\nTen days later, the bathroom was not finished. My other lease was about to expire and the holiday was approaching. He agreed to let me move in as the toilet was being bolted down. The tile was finished. Walls needed some paint. Two days after moving in, I leave to visit family for the holiday. I will add, that I got a strange vibe from him early on and decided to put cameras inside the place.\n\nSo while I was away I verbally agreed that he could finish the bathroom and replace the thermostat. During my time away he came in once with a paint can, never finished painting. He stopped in once to use the bathroom. A few other times, I was not sure what exactly his purpose was. I did see he was doing something to my TV (maybe trying to charge his flip phone).\n\nThis past Thursday (I was back in the area), he asked if he could stop in to get the previous water bill that the previous tenant had left. I agreed. I return home Friday to find that he removed both bedroom doors to be repainted (the doors had a few minor scuff marks on them, but I didn't think they needed repainting). I called and asked what happened to the doors, he was surprised that I was back. I guess he didn't notice that the number of packing boxes had decreased. He said that he would return them the following day. I later get an email saying that he will return them in a few days. I feel that this is an open-ended I will come and go until the doors are put back statement.\n\nI reviewed the video footage and saw that he had invited the neighbors in to see his work on the door removal. They stepped inside but ultimately did not go any further.\n\nI am concerned about my personal property. Several times he left the front door open for several minutes at a time.\n\nWhat are my options to get him to stop? The lease states that I am supposed to receive written notice of entry.

I've read all of the information about 529 plans at the link listed below (I've seen that website recommended several times on this subreddit). My understanding from the website is that the money my nephew receives from my 529 plan counts as student income and reduces his eligibility for financial aid by 50% of the amount in the 529 plan. So if I gave him $4000 from the 529 plan, his eligibility for financial aid would be reduced by $2000. Is that correct?\n\nThe reason I ask is because I used google to try and find more information about opening a 529 plan for my nephew and read some articles that cautioned against opening one up. These articles said that a 529 plan, while well intentioned, can be a major detriment to the student's ability to file for financial aid on their FAFSA. But if my logic is correct in my previous paragraph, wouldn't it ALWAYS be a better idea to open up a 529 plan and have the child's financial aid reduced? Could the reduction in financial aid outweigh the pros of having a 529 plan?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about how the mechanics work for giving my nephew the money from my 529 plan. I understand that I will be the owner of the 529 plan and he will be the beneficiary, but how does he physically get the money when he pays for his college expenses? Would I get the money in the form of a check and give it to him? Does the money go directly to my nephew in the form of a check or deposited in his bank account?\n\nThanks in advance :)\n\nhttps://www.savingforcollege.com/intro-to-529s/what-is-a-529-plan",

Since FAFSA uses prior-prior year for income and tax information, this will not affect the FAFSA within that 4 year period. \n\nFor mechanics, you can have the account provider pay the school directly or write a check to you or the student.

I last seen my truck when my boss picked me up early morning of the 28th, at my place, and when I got back home on the 30th at around 1pm, my truck was gone and I originally had thought it was my landlord because it had no plates or insurance. Now they're telling me it has been flipped and they think it's me. Not sure what to do. Thank you for your time. \n\nAlso, Ontario, Canada. ",

It's up to the Authorities to check any nearby Cameras that might have seen your car from where you left it to where it was dumped.   \nThe no insurance thing kind of sucks cause your not going to get any extra help from them. If you can prove it was your Landlord you can sue him for the book value of the Truck at least.   \n\n\nWhere are you from cause different States/Provinces have different laws",

        "desc": "QUESTION: WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED \"MATERIAL\" IN A CHILD CUSTODY CASE? WHAT TYPE OF EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE WHEN MAKING A CASE FOR PERJURY/AGGRAVATED PERJURY?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am residing in Texas. my ex-fianc\u00e9 J and I have a 3 year old son together, A. about 1.5 years ago, I relapsed into meth addiction and kept it hidden for several months, until one day J went through my purse and found paraphernalia. after a lengthy fight it was ultimately agreed upon that I would work towards sobriety and that he would turn a blind eye as long as a)it was kept away from our son (duh) and b)I followed his \"rules\" about it, such as a \"curfew.\" this was in march. over the next few months, he would go through my purse or my car or dresser and take pictures and/or videos of anything condemning that he would find, to use as evidence against me in a custody battle, should anything happen between us. fast forward to Oct. 26, the day we broke up. he had left for work already as I was coming home from a friends house (I intentionally stayed the night to spite him) and he told me that he had taken our son to his sisters house, and that it was over between us. I told him that I would leave A with him for the weekend so that I could square away living arrangements, and that I would be back for A on Sunday. I take a shower, gather some belongings, and ask my friend to come pick me up because my tags are expired on my car. I leave my car, LOCKED, at his house. I also left a piece of paraphernalia in the center console, because I didn't want to travel with it, so I am 100% certain that the car was locked when I left. when I returned on Sunday night, the locks on the doors had been changed, the lights were all out, and he refused to answer the door. I called the local law enforcement, who sent out two officers. I explained, saying that all I wanted from him were my child and my belongings., and one officer went inside. when she returned, she told me that A was at his sisters house, and that all of my belongings were in trash bags in my car, meaning he had broken into my car to put my things inside. she then said he had mentioned being concerned about drug use, which I admitted to (I realize I should not have done this) and she searched my belongings and my person and found nothing. she reentered the home, and minutes later returned outside with my paraphernalia in hand, as well as a bag with a negligible amount of meth inside. she said that he told her that he found the paraphernalia in dresser, and that he had found the substance ONE MONTH PRIOR and had held onto it. (the officer even said, \"why would he keep it for a month? why wouldn't he get rid of it and get it out of the house?\") again, I admitted that it was mine (again I realize I shouldn't have done so) and the police confiscated the items and advised me to go the following day to pick up my son, as it was getting late. there is much more to the story between then and now, but here is the part that pertains to my question: he filed for a TRO against me, on the basis that he is concerned for our sons safety. however, he completely lied on his sworn affidavit. he stated that he \"had suspected drug use\" and that on or around Oct 28 (that Sunday) he found the paraphernalia and drugs, and called the police. but as I had not been in the home since Friday morning, he couldn't have gone through my purse. in addition, I was the one who called the police as a result of the locks to my home having been changed. my question is, if I could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he lied, could he be found guilty of perjury? would this false statement be considered material to the outcome of our ongoing child custody case, since he depicted himself as being ignorant of the drug use and concerned for A's safety when was actually not only fully aware but taking advantage of it by collecting evidence against me over the course of several MONTHS? since everything began, I have since maintained sobriety, recently became employed (I became a stay at home mom back in July when our child care moved away), and reside with my father in a stable and nurturing environment. I can provide witnesses (the police officers who arrived that evening, my father to whom J had told everything about my drug use and had sent the aforementioned pictures/videos), more than likely a police report assuming one was made in regards to the evidence they had seized, text/facebook messages, and if he still has the pictures/videos on his phone, then they would have a time stamp that proves that he was fully aware of the drug use. J claims that he is concerned for A's well-being regardless of these facts, and is seeking full custody. if he could, he would likely sever all contact between my son & me as if I had died. would the court agree that his false statements were made intentionally, and with the intention of affecting the outcome of our child custody case? if so, what would be the best way to proceed? do I need to file any paperwork, or just bring it up at the upcoming TRO hearing? I have spoken minimally with an attorney at a local legal aid office and am awaiting a response as to whether or not they will be able to take on my case. I just wanted to see if it would be worth gathering the evidence and bringing it to my attorney.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: J has had A for a little over two weeks and has gone to great lengths to keep him hidden from me, without so much as letting me video call him or speak with him over the phone. the TRO was granted, but I was never served papers, and thus to my understanding the TRO is not enforceable\n\n&#x200B;",

        "topComment": "The fact that you haven't received a TRO is irrelevant. Yes, the TRO itself is currently unenforceable, but that is not really why he filed it: he filed it to record evidence that you were a drug user, which will make him the primary parent in Texas and will allow him to recover child support from you. You've already lost this case because you admitted that you were a drug user to the police.",
