So for the three different Classifiers the Results break down as follows
Support vector:
Development Data: 96% accuracy with only 2 incorect predictions
Eval Data: 88% accuracy with 6 incorrect predictions
Random Forest:
Development Data: 90% accuracy with only 5 incorrect predictions
Eval Data: 90% accuracy on the Test Data as well
LSTM:
Training Data: 76% on the final training batch
development Data: 80% accuracy with 10 incorrect thought with more training perhaps a better model could be developed
Eval Data: 78% accuracy
